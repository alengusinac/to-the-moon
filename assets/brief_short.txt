Read Our Story arrow: same hover effect as previous.

Quote "And im floating.." with automatic quotation marks. Quotation marks placed a little behind quote start and end. CSS :before :after??? HTML tag?

Save Venture header: Venture with little transparancy and placed a little behind Save.

Menu hamburger: Fixed on screen.
Centering hamburger on hover.

Menu items: dropshadow on text

Menu items Desktop: Pink bottom border on hover. No dropshadow on border(if possible).

Cookie text: Same on both mobile and desktop. Little glow effect on text. OBS! missing arrow in desktop design.

Extra quote on Desktop version. Faded with a pink-white-pink gradient from left-top to right-bottom.

?? "Last text-section": "Planet Earth is blue" and "and there's nothing I can do" should be on seperate lines on Desktop version. And the rest should be in the last seciton above?? (what rest??)

Picture of Major Tom should float right so text can wrap it on top and bottom. OBS! No Major Tom picture on mobile version.

Page should look good with no CSS. (readability)
